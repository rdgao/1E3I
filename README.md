# 1E3I
Multiple inhibitory neuron EI circuit model project for CCCN 2019

Linear and nonlinear rate model with parameter sweep experiments to reproduce differential effect of suppressing PV and SOM inhibitory neurons on stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) in the auditory cortex (Natan et al 2015, eLife). Also include reproduction of iso-frequency model from Park & Geffen 2019, biorxiv.
