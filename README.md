# 1E3I - Multiple inhibitory neuron EI circuit model

Project for CCCN 2019: Richard Gao, Auguste Schulz, Heydeh Rezaei. Supervised by Maria Geffen (+ Brent Doiron & Ken Miller)

Linear and nonlinear rate model with parameter sweep experiments to reproduce differential effect of suppressing PV and SOM inhibitory neurons on stimulus specific adaptation (SSA) in the auditory cortex (Natan et al 2015, eLife). Also include reproduction of iso-frequency model from Park & Geffen 2019, biorxiv.

Code is badly annotated by everything in the notebooks run.
